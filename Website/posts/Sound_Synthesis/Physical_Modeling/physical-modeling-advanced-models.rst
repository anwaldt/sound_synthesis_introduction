More advanced physical models can be designed,
based on the principles explained in the previous sections.

Resonant Bodies & Coupling
--------------------------

The simple lowpass filter in the example can be replaced
by more sophisticated models.
For instruments with multiple strings,
coupling between strings can be implemented.
