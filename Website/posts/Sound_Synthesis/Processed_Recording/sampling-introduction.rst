Pierre Schaeffer & Musique Concrète
-----------------------------------

The use of recorded material for musical compositions
dates back to Pierre Schaeffer, who started experiments
with turntables after World War II.
He recorded environmental sounds and musical instruments,
arranged them, altered the playback
speed and used loops in what then became *musique concrète*.
These techniques are well-known nowadays, but were
a completely novel experience in th 1940s.

Although an engineer by profession, Pierre Schaeffer did
not only explore the technical means for composing with
recorded sound. With the theory of the *objet sonore* he 
also lay the foundation for a theoretical and aesthetical discourse
of acousmatic music (Schaeffer, 2012).

-----

The *Cinq Études de bruits* (1948), the first published
works of *musique concrète*, use various sources and
techniques.

After the first experiments, Schaeffer started
to involve musicians for taking the concept to the next level.
With Pierre Henry he relized the *Symphonie pour un homme seul*
in 1950.
This acousmatic composition made use of various
additional techniques, including spatial aspects.

Early Popular Music
-------------------

Experimental approaches in popular music took up the
idea of sampling and integrated recorded sounds,
using them especially for intro and outro effects.
Since their pioneering 1967 album
*Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band*, the Beatles
worked with sounds from mammals, birds  and insects
in almoast all of their albums (Brumm, 1012).
Other examples for early experiments with sampled
material are the *The Beach Boys* and *Pink Floyd*.

Digital Sampling
----------------

Early devices capable of digital sampling are
the *Fairlight CMI* (1979) and the *Synclavier II* (1980).
These expensive, bulky devices were already used 
in various productions.

**Linn Drum**

The *Linn Drum* (1982) represents a breakthrough for digital sampling.
Using 8 bit technique, it offers a set of drum sounds,
which can be found in many 1980s pop productions.
