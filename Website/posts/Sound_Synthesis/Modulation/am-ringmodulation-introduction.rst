Amplitude modulation (AM) and Ringmodulation are
essentially the same technique, yet with a slight
variation. For both, formula and signal flow
diagram are the same:

:math:`\displaystyle y(t) = x(t) \cdot m(t)`
   

Ringmodulation is an audio effect, used since the
early days of analog sound synthesis and electronic music.
Karlheinz Stockhausen used the ringmodulator in
various works as an instrument, as for example
in Mixtur (1964):
