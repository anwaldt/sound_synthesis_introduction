Combining Approaches
--------------------


In the 1990s and early 2000s, most known
synthesis algorithms existed and provided
more and more convincing results, due to the
increasing computational power.
In order to overcome the drawbacks of individual
synthesis approaches, paradigms are combined
and novel, hybrid approaches are created.


Deep Learning & Neural Nets
---------------------------

Deep learning and neural nets have been used
as helper tools in sound synthesis for many years.
However, the direct use for the generation of
sound is rather new and currently the hot topic
in sound synthesis and processing.


Control and Mapping
-------------------

Although the control of sound synthesis is not a
new topic, it remains one of the most active ones.
Synthesis algorithms are able to produce a large
variety of sounds in real-time since the 1990s,
but their integration into musical instruments
is a much wider topic, with many possibilities to explore
and stil lags behind.
