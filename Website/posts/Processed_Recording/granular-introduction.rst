Granular synthesis is a special  form 
of sample based synthesis, making use
of micro sections of audio material,
called grains, sometimes particles or atoms.
This principle can be used to manipulate
sounds by time-stretching and pitch-shifting
or to generate sound textures (Roads, 2004).

Early Analog
------------

John Cage's *Williams Mix*, realized in 1952-53
shows some of the earliest granular approaches.

Iannis Xenakis was the first to refer to
Dennis Gabor's quantum theory and the
elementary signal (Gabor, 1946) for musical applications.

Early Digital
-------------

The possibilities to use granular synthesis
grew rapidly with the advent of digital sampling
and new composers made use of the technique.

Barry Truax, who was visiting the TU Studio
as guest professor in 2015-16 is known as one
of the pioneers of digital granular composition (Truax, 1987).
His soundscape-influenced works use the technique for
generating rich textures, as in *Riverrun*:

Horacio Vaggione made use of granular processing for
his mixed music pieces.
The original *Scir* - for bass flute and tape (which is granular processed bass flute) - has ben produced at the TU Studio in 1988:

In 2018, the TU Studio performed the piece
with flutist Erik Drescher and made a binaural recording:
