Subtractive Families
====================

Based on the same principle, different families of
subtractive synthesizers can be defined -
without claim to completeness:

- analog modular
- analog monophonic
- analog polyphonic
- virtual analog / analog modeling


These sub-groups of subtractive synthesis have
different characteristics and are used for different
applications.

-----

Analog Modular
--------------

The first subtractive synthesizers were
large, cupboard-like devices and rather expensive.
Although multiple voices are possible, they
are designed as monophonic instruments.
Two well known and opposite examples are the
first models released by Bob Moog on the US east coast
and Don Buchla on the west coast.

- Moog Synthesizer (1965)
  - *Switched on Bach*, Wendy Carlos, 1968

    Bob Moog brought the typical VCO-VCA-VCF
    approach in a rack with a keyboard.
    It could hence be performed like a
    typical piano-like instrument.
    
- Buchla 100 (1965)
  - *Silver Apples of the Moon*, Morton Subotnick, 1967

    Although the Buchla works with slightly different
    concepts than subtractive synthesis in the Moog
    synthesizers, it is mentioned in this list.

Analog Monophonic
-----------------

Analog monophonic synthesizers used the same techniques,
yet in a more compact design and not fully modular.
This made them more affordable and hence more
disseminated and used.


**Minimoog Model D (1970)**

 The idea of monophonic analog subtractive synthesis is
 usually linked to the Minimoog.

 Designed as a fully integrated musical instrument,
 the Minimoog could be used as a virtous tool
 for expressive musical performances.
 Chick Corea's Minimoog solo, starting at 4:20,
 is a prime example:

**EMS VCS 3 (1969)**


  The semi-modular EMS allows access to the
  signal flow in a patching matrix.
  It is thus more suited for experimemtal
  sounds, as used by Pink Floyd in
  *Welcome to the Machine* for the wobbling
  machine sounds in the beginning:

**Roland TB 303 (1982)**

  Although released several years later - and for
  a different application - the TB303 fits
  best into this family.
  The TB 303 was intended to be used as an
  accompanying instrument for musicians.
  It has a different interface, a programmable
  step sequencer.

  Due to the quirky filters it failed as a
  bass accompaniment but gave birth to techno
  and especially acid:

Analog Polyphonic
-----------------

After the monophonic analog synths of the 70s,
which were intended as solo instruments,
came the polyphonic ones.

Polyphonic analog synthesizers shaped the
sound of 80s pop (and especially synth-pop)  music with their recognizable
sound, often used as pads and harmonic foundation
or for bass lines.

Virtual Analog
--------------

When digital technology was ready, it took over
and various synthesizers were released which emulated
the principles of subtractive synthesis.
These devices were much cheaper and the digital
means could provide more voices with better memory options.

Virtual analog synthesizers were the backbone of
trance development. They lack some of the analog
warmth but are tighter in sound.
