Physical modeling emulates actual physical
processes with digital means -
oscillators, resonators and acoustic impedance
are modeled with buffers and filters, respectively
LTI systems.
Although first realized when computers had sufficient
power, the foundations are much older.
Hiller et al. (1971) were the first to transport
the 1774 wave equation by d'Alambert to the digital
domain for synthesizing sounds of plucked strings.

Early Hardware
--------------

Although physical modeling algorithms sound great,
offer good means for control and enable the design
of interesting instruments, their had less
impact on the evolution of  music
and digital instruments.
Hardware synths for physical modeling from
the 1990s, like the *Korg Prophecy* or the
*Yamaha VL1* did not become a success, in the
first place.
There are many possible reasons for the lack of success.
Cheaper and larger memory made sampling instruments
more powerful and virtual analog synthesizers
sounded more attractive, followed by the second wave
of analog synths.

Modular
-------

Since simple physical models are easily implemented on
small embedded systems, various modules exist on the market:

Physical Models in Experimental Music
-------------------------------------

*Eikasia* (1999) by Hans Tutschku was realized
using the IRAM software Modalys:
