Concatenative synthesis is an evolution of granular synthesis,
first introduced in the context of speech synthesis and
processing (Charpentier, 1986; Hamon, 1989).

Concatenative synthesis for musical applications
has been introduced by Diemo Schwarz.
*Corpus-based concatenative synthesis* (Schwarz, 2000; Schwarz 2006)
splices audio recordings into *units* and calculates
audio features for each unit.
During synthesis, *unit selection* can be performed by
navigating the multidimensional feature space and selected units
are *concatenated*.
