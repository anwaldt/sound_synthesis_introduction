Applications
------------

While every digital sound synthesis approach
stands for itself due to its unique characteristics,
they all come with inherent
strengths and limitations with regard to specific tasks and applications.
[Fig.1]_ shows a list of synthesis goals with suitable
approaches by Misra et al. (2009).
In general, frequency-domain methods are less suited
for time-critical tasks, involving transients and
textures.
Also, the table in Fig.1 suggests the versatility of granular
and concatenative synthesis.

Many methods for sound synthesis - analog or digital -
have gained their status as an indipendent musical
instrument, with characteristic sound properties.
Some shaped the development of popular music and spawned new
musical genres.
This includes sampling - with a close link to rap music,
subractive synthesis in many ways and as backbone of
techno music, and FM synthesis - with the DX7
literally playing a part in most 1980s pop hits.
Such influential synthesizers have again been synthesized.
Virtual analog - also analog modeling - emulates vintage
subtractive synthesizers in hard- and software and
software synthesizers simulate classic FM synthesizers.
